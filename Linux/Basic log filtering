journalctl Log Filtering
 
Massive amounts of information exist within Linux logs, and the challenge is in knowing how to extract it.
 
Steps to filter logs:
1. Check if journalctl is running in persistent mode to ensure that logs are saved across reboots.
    Run: grep Storage /etc/systemd/journald.conf
      Output should appear as below:
       ```bash
       #Storage=auto
       ```
   1a. If not, then modify these settings: 
    Run: sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf
  
      ```bash
      #  This file is part of systemd.
      #
      #  systemd is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
      #  under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
      #  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
      #  (at your option) any later version.
      #
      # Entries in this file show the compile time defaults.
      # You can change settings by editing this file.
      # Defaults can be restored by simply deleting this file.
      #
      # See journald.conf(5) for details.
  
      [Journal]
      #Storage=auto
      #Compress=yes
      ``` 
   Uncomment the Storage=auto and save the file.
 
2. Whenever the journal.conf file is modified, systemd-journald needs to be restarted before the changes take effect.
   Run: sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
         Log persistence is now enabled.
