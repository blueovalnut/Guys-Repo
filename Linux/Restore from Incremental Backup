# Restoring data from Incremental Backups

First step in establishing an incremental backup system is to create a baseline backup, preferrably as soon
as the system is built and ready for production. 

Backup Initialization Command Syntax:
tar cvvWf [name of tar repository].tar --listed-incremental=[name of backup file].snar --level=0 [directory 
to save to]

Backup Extraction Syntax:
tar xvvf [name of tar repository].tar -R -C [location of tarball] [file to extract]
